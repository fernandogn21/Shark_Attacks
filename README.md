## Sharks Attack

Date: The date when the shark attack occurred.

Country: The country where the shark attack took place, indicating the geographical location of the incident.

Species: The specific species of shark involved in the attack.

Activity: The activity the victim was engaged in at the time of the shark attack, providing context about the circumstances leading to the incident.

Fatality (Yes/No): A binary indicator (yes or no) to denote whether the shark attack resulted in a fatal injury to the victim.




### Hypothesis 1: Shark Attack World Bite
When and Where Do They Strike?


Problem Statement: Understanding the global distribution of shark attacks in relation to equatorial parallels, seasons of the year, and water temperatures is essential for implementing effective safety measures and gaining insights into shark behavior.

Hypothesis: Analyzing the date of the attack, the location (country), and the season of the year will reveal patterns regarding the distribution of shark attacks. Specifically, we aim to determine if attacks in the Southern Hemisphere predominantly occur during their summer, the Northern Hemisphere during their summer, and if there is an increased incidence closer to the equator.

Parameters:
- Date
- Country

### Hypothesis 2: Deadliest Sharks
Most Dangerous Species

Problem Statement:
Determining which shark species are most likely to cause fatal versus non-fatal injuries is vital for designing effective safety measures and educational programs to minimize shark attack risks.

Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that species such as the Great White Shark, Tiger Shark, and Bull Shark are more likely to cause fatal injuries compared to other species, based on their higher frequency of involvement in fatal attacks as opposed to non-fatal ones.

Parameters:
- Species
- Fatality

### Hypothesis 3: Risky Business
Activities That Attract Shark Attacks

Problem Statement:
Analyzing the activities victims were engaged in during shark attacks, along with the severity of injuries, aims to identify high-risk activities and enhance safety guidelines.

Hypothesis:
We propose that activities involving significant water disturbance, such as surfing and spearfishing, result in a higher proportion of fatal shark attacks compared to less disruptive activities like swimming or snorkeling. By correlating the type of activity with the severity of the injury, we can pinpoint which activities are most perilous.

Parameters:
- Activity
- Fatal Injury
- Date
